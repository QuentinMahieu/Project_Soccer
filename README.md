# Project_Soccer

## Our Goal:
Can we discover how to build a winning football (soccer) team?

## Our Approach:
Weâ€™re going to examine the strongest performers in three of the top leagues in Europe  (England, Spain and Italy) - and see if we can determine how much of a role 5 identified variables play in success. These are:

1. **Spend on players: 
..1. The total transfer fees spent on players for that season.
..2. Wages spent on players
2. **Average Age
3. **Average Height
4. **Diversity**: examining the makeup of a team by the origin of players
5. **Cohesiveness**: the years a playing group has played together.
